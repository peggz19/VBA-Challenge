# VBA-Challenge

Hello and Welcome to Peggy Tadi's VBA Challenge.

You might notice that this Git repository is full of different files but the main ones are alphabetical_testing and Multiple_year_stock_data.

Because of the large size of Multiple Year Stock Data, my computer kept lagging. Therefore, if it looks like my file is full of mistakes, please refer to alphabetical_testing excel file where everything worked perfectly.

Note* I changed the orginal data of ABB in alphabetical_testing to what we have in Multiple Year Stock Data in order to compare my results with the provided images.

THANK YOU THANK YOU
